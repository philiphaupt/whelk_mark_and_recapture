# The calculation of the total population is specified as follows:

# m2 – number of marked individuals recaptured on the second (subsequent) sampling event. 
# n2 – total number caught on second sampling event. 
# n1 - total number caught and marked on the first marking event.
# N – total population.
# The total population is then estimated as:  N ̂=(n_1+1)(n_2+ 1)/(m_2+ 1) - 1 
# 
# Such that m_2/n_2 =n_1/N  where N is the total (estimated) population.
# This can be expressed as  N=(〖(n〗_1*n_2))/m_2
